# Synthetic Biology

## Machine Learning for designing BioCircuits

As a part of the EC500D1 Project in Computational Synthetic Biology for Engineers,
our team did an exploratory project to investigate how machine learning can be
used to better design BioCircuits. We decided to build upon [Cello](http://cellocad.org/),
a genetic circuit engineering tool. We chose Cello because :

1. Familiarity with Cello (I work in the same lab)
1. Cello designs that resemble digital circuits that have binary inputs and outputs
1. Being able to design BioCircuits that satisfy digital logic functions allowed us to abstract inner functionality
