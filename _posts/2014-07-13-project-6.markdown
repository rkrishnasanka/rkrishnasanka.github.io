## RF Energy Harvester Paper Summary

### Original Paper

"A 90-nm CMOS Threshold-Compensated RF Energy Harvester", Papotto, Carrara, and Palmisano, IEEE
Journal of Solid-State Circuits, Vol. 46, No. 9, Sept. 2011, pp. 1985-1997.

### Summary

This article summarizes the design and the philosophy of building a Threshold-Compensated RF Energy Harvester which are used for powering wireless sensor and other communication devices which do not have a power supply or a battery source. First the concept of a rectifier being used as an energy harvester is introduced continued by a short description of these designs are realized for our specific problem. The latter part of the article describes the energy harvester as a system and provides a walkthrough of the design process of the system.
