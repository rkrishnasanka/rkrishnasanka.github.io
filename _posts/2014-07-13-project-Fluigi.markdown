![Fluigi](/img/cidar/fluigi.png)
# Fluigi

The Fluigi Project consists of open source tools and open standards that are
used for automating design of Microfluidic Chips.

<br />

![MINT](/img/cidar/mint.png)
## MINT

MINT is standard being developed at CIDAR Lab that is used for specifying
Microfluidic devices.

<br />

## Fluigi Core

The Fluigi Core is set of tools and libraries that can give the user the ability
to place and route Microfluidic Devices that follow the MINT standard for
specifying netlists and designs.


<br />

![Neptune](/img/cidar/neptune.png)
## Neptune

Neptune is the application that ties together the various research projects
under the Fluigi umbrella. It's a part of the work being done as a part of the
iGEM 2016 entry into the Hardware Track.

<br />


![3DuF](/img/cidar/3duf.png)
## 3DuF

3DuF is the first completely open source interactive microfluidic system designer that readily supports state of the art design automation algorithms. 

<br />


![LFR](/img/cidar/lfr.png)
## Liquid Flow Relationships (LFR)

LFR is a Domain specific hardware description language inspired by verilog to describe microfluidic architectures.

<br />


## Vulcan

Vulcan introduces hardware primitives that enables biologists to perform complete
biological protocols inside Microfluidics.
